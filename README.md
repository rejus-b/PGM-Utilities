# PGM-Utilities

This was a project for the comp1921 module where we were supposed to create a set of utilities that can manipulate .pgm files in different ways.

Run the testscript to make sure it works as intended before use case.

Utilities include:

- An echo module of a pgm.
- Comparing two pgm files.
- Converting from ascii to binary and vice versa in the pgmn format.
- Reducing the size of an image with lossy compression.
- Being able to tile a pgm image into multiple images.
- Being able to stitch together multiple tiled images into a single pgm.

Further use instructions can be found in the readme in the assingment folder: [Link to src/readme](assignment_1)
